Informed Consent will be developed in this file.

Current Suggestions:
1. It needs to go beyond simply asking the person if they consent whithout a sincere attempt to infom them about what they are consenting to.
2. Giving them a quiz to see if they understand what they are consenting to could be a powerful tool.
3. Should provide ongoing practical ways to exist where all punishments are prestated and do not violate guaranteed rights.
4. Could be renegotiated in practical ways.
