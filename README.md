# PhilosophicalVersionControl
Version controlled version of my philosophy ideas that others can easily follow, comment on, and include in their own philosophy.

1. Philosophical Version Control
2. Enables pragmatism since it is updatable in ways that notify interested parties. “It’s ok to change your mind, just let the interested parties know!”
3. Should be easy to use
4. Books, articles, classes and other more expository works can include a link to the version of the canonical arguments they are based on.
5. Could link to evidence that supports a statement, where a canonical version of the evidence is also stored in the repository
6. Simple tags could indicate that you are basing an argument on a versioned repository item.
7. Simple tags may also indicate that you accept an included item except for the indicated portions that you do not accept. Or the opposite - a tag could say you reject an included item except for these explicit lines.
8. Communities could form around different decompositions of dead or living philosophers works if copyright is granted. Might employ a lot of graduate students!
9. Should be easy to move to a new server, but the urls will need to change and the watched items Will have to be transported too. May require a custom import tool going between each service or perhaps a middleware that anyone can implement translation to and from. O(n) parities portability.
10. Philosopher can track who imports their arguments
11. Can be the basis for debates that are principled and documented
12. Excellent auto documentation for history of ideas
13. Could this become the basis for different AI systems that attempt to implement particular philosophies?
