The State is:

1. An unchosen association for those born into it or captured through war, and for those that can not find reasonable alternatives to the state style of arrangement.
2. Most of us can not easily escape living in a traditional state because there are no suitable alternatives that we can access.
3. The state primarily controls through punishments that take something from someone that they already posses (e.g. health, well-being, freedom, wealth) should they not follow a set of laws that the individual has no pratical way to unilaterally escape from.
4. Because we can not easily escape and it threatens to take things from us if we do not obey, the traditional state is an unethical form of coercion.
